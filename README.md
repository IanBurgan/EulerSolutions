# Project Euler
Each file is the Python solution for the corresponding problem on projecteuler.net.
Many solutions feature some optimizations, but many are not the best or fastest solution.
I encourage anyone who finds themselves reading this to attempt the problems themselves,
and to only use my solutions to compare to theirs.
