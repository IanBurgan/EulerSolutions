# Project Euler
Each file is the Pytho or C solution for the corresponding problem on projecteuler.net.
The first 50 problems are solved in Python, and problems 51 and up are solved in C.
Many solutions feature some optimizations, but many are not the best or fastest solution.
I encourage anyone who finds themselves reading this to attempt the problems themselves,
and to only use my solutions to compare to theirs.
